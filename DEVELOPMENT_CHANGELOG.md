## [Previous] - Brand Interface Route Conflict Resolution
**Date**: December 19, 2024
**Type**: Bug Fix

### 🐛 **Fixed Next.js Route Conflict in Brand Interface**

#### **Issue:**
Development server failed to start with error: "You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('orderId' !== 'poId')". This was caused by conflicting dynamic routes in the brand orders section.

#### **Root Cause:**
The `app/brand/orders/` directory contained both `[orderId]` and `[poId]` dynamic route folders, which Next.js cannot distinguish at the same path level.

#### **Solution Implemented:**

##### **Route Restructuring**
- **Separated Purchase Orders**: Moved `[poId]` routes to `app/brand/orders/purchase-orders/[poId]/`
- **Separated Regular Orders**: Moved `[orderId]` routes to `app/brand/orders/regular-orders/[orderId]/`
- **Created Index Pages**: Added proper index pages for both route types

##### **Updated Navigation Links**

.h-full /* Full height within grid */

/* Widget Content */
.min-h-[120px] /* Minimum content height */
.flex-1 /* Flexible content area */
.overflow-y-auto /* Scrollable content */
```

##### **Drag-and-Drop Persistence**
```typescript
onReorder={async (updatedWidgets) => {
  // Update positions
  const reorderedWidgets = updatedWidgets.map((widget, index) => ({
    ...widget,
    position: index
  }))
  
  // Update local state immediately
  reorderedWidgets.forEach((widget, index) => {
    updateWidget(widget.id, { ...widget, position: index })
