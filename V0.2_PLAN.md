# v0.2 Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for v0.2 development, addressing the feedback received from users and implementing improvements to maintain high code quality and deployment safety.

## Issues Identified & Solutions

### 1. Approval System Bug
**Problem**: Users couldn't perform actions on certain workflow stages, specifically DEMO-002 approval actions weren't working.

**Root Cause**: 
- Test data was outdated and didn't include proper approval actions
- Workflow structure didn't match UI expectations
- Approval actions weren't properly configured

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated seed data with comprehensive workflow including approval actions
- ✅ Added proper approval action configuration with roles and auto-approve settings
- ✅ Created test page to verify approval system functionality
- ✅ Enhanced workflow with realistic stages: Assembly → Quality Check → Packaging

### 2. Item Status Defaults
**Problem**: Items required activation before they could be used.

**Root Cause**: 
- Items were created with "inactive" status by default
- UI components expected activation before showing active stage component

**Solution**:
- ✅ Modified item creation to default to "active" status
- ✅ Removed activation requirement from UI components
- ✅ Updated item detail view to show active stage component for all items
- ✅ Removed activation buttons from items table

### 3. Test Data Quality
**Problem**: Test data was outdated and causing confusion.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive test workflow with 3 stages
- ✅ Added multiple test items in different stages
- ✅ Included proper action configurations for all action types
- ✅ Added realistic metadata and timestamps

## Technical Implementation Details

### Updated Workflow Structure
```
Stage 1: Assembly
├── Scan QR Code (required)
└── Assembly Notes (optional)

Stage 2: Quality Check
├── Visual Inspection (required)
├── QC Approval (required)
└── QC Notes (optional)

Stage 3: Packaging
├── Final Scan (required)
├── Package Photo (required)
└── Final Approval (required)
```

### Action Types Supported
- **Scan**: QR code scanning with validation
- **Photo**: Image capture with quality settings
- **Note**: Text input with prompts and length limits
- **Approval**: Role-based approval with auto-approve options
- **Measurement**: Numeric input with units and validation
- **Inspection**: Checklist-based inspections

### Test Items Created
- **DEMO-001**: In Assembly stage (stage-1)
- **DEMO-002**: In Quality Check stage (stage-2) - has approval actions
- **DEMO-003**: In Packaging stage (stage-3) - has approval actions

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test workflow progression and data flow
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user journeys
4. **Manual Testing**: Verify approval system with test page

### Deployment Safety
1. **Build Verification**: Ensure all tests pass before deployment
2. **Staging Environment**: Test changes in staging before production
3. **Rollback Plan**: Quick rollback capability if issues arise
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of application health

### Code Quality Gates
1. **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
2. **Linting**: ESLint with strict rules
3. **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code style
4. **Testing**: Minimum 80% test coverage
5. **Security**: Automated security scanning

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- [ ] All approval actions work correctly
- [ ] Items default to active status
- [ ] Workflow progression functions properly
- [ ] Test data is realistic and comprehensive

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] < 2 second page load times
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
