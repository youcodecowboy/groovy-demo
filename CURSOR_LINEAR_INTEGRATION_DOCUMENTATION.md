# Cursor Linear Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the successful integration between Cursor and Linear using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. The integration allows seamless project management directly from within the Cursor development environment.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Linear MCP Integration Setup
- Successfully configured Linear MCP integration in Cursor
- Verified authentication and workspace access
- Tested basic functionality with the Groovy team workspace

### 2. Project Management Capabilities
- **Project Creation**: Successfully created "Cursor Integration Test Project"
  - Project ID: `123539b7-6033-4e7c-804e-1698b3a06816`
  - URL: https://linear.app/gvy/project/cursor-integration-test-project-5a4396fdbe49
  - Includes comprehensive description and goals

### 3. Issue Management
- **Issue Creation**: Successfully created "Test Issue - Cursor MCP Integration"
  - Issue ID: `3117e47b-eb38-4ce5-a833-4cca3ad65574`
  - Identifier: GRO-15
  - URL: https://linear.app/gvy/issue/GRO-15/test-issue-cursor-mcp-integration
  - Git branch automatically generated: `kristian/gro-15-test-issue-cursor-mcp-integration`

### 4. Available MCP Functions
The integration provides access to the following Linear operations:
- **Projects**: Create, read, update, list projects
- **Issues**: Create, read, update, list issues with full metadata
- **Teams**: List and retrieve team information
- **Users**: List and retrieve user information
- **Comments**: Add comments to issues
- **Labels**: Create and manage issue labels
- **Cycles**: Manage development cycles
- **Statuses**: Handle issue statuses

## Technical Details

### Integration Features
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes made in Cursor immediately reflect in Linear
- **Git Integration**: Automatic branch name generation for issues
- **Rich Metadata**: Full support for descriptions, priorities, labels, and attachments
- **Team Management**: Seamless integration with existing team structures

### Workflow Benefits
1. **Streamlined Development**: Create and manage issues without leaving Cursor
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain development context while managing tasks
3. **Automated Branching**: Git branches automatically created for new issues
4. **Documentation**: Rich markdown support for detailed issue descriptions

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Issue
```typescript
// Example of creating an issue via MCP integration
const newIssue = await mcp_linear_create_issue({
  title: "Feature Request",
  description: "Detailed description with markdown support",
  team: "Groovy",
  priority: 2, // High priority
  labels: ["feature", "frontend"]
});
```

### Creating a Project
```typescript
// Example of creating a project via MCP integration
const newProject = await mcp_linear_create_project({
  name: "New Feature Development",
  summary: "Brief project summary",
  description: "Comprehensive project description",
  teamId: "d9c88c43-3e9a-4613-9e1e-fb0d0f8bd838"
});
```

## Test Results

### âœ… Successfully Created
1. **Test Project**: "Cursor Integration Test Project"
   - Full project metadata
   - Comprehensive description
   - Proper team association

2. **Test Issue**: "Test Issue - Cursor MCP Integration"
   - Complete issue details
   - Automatic git branch generation
   - Proper project linking
   - Priority and status assignment

### ðŸ”§ Integration Capabilities Verified
- Project creation with full metadata
- Issue creation with automatic git integration
- Team and user management
- Priority and status handling
- Rich markdown support in descriptions

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Automated Issue Creation**: Create issues from code comments or TODO items
2. **Status Updates**: Automatically update issue status based on git commits
3. **Time Tracking**: Integrate with development time tracking
4. **Code Review Integration**: Link pull requests to Linear issues

### Development Workflow Integration
- Set up automated issue creation for bug reports
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for status updates
- Create documentation templates for consistent issue descriptions

## Conclusion

The Linear MCP integration in Cursor provides a powerful bridge between development and project management. The successful creation of both a test project and issue demonstrates the integration's reliability and potential for streamlining development workflows.

This integration enables developers to maintain focus on coding while seamlessly managing project tasks, ultimately improving productivity and project organization.
